She goes by the moniker LOCK as the guitarist for the band RAISE A SUILEN. She is a Poppin'Party fan. Rokka usually wears large glasses, but takes them off when she performs.\n\nShe is from Gifu Prefecture. She attends Haneoka instead of Hanasakigawa, the closer school, due to Haneoka's scholarship program. She in the same class as Asuka and Ako. Rokka works at Galaxy Live House, as well as her relative's bath house where she lives.\n\nEver since she was at elementary school, Rokka failed at everything she tried, including her studies. Playing guitar was the only thing she had worked hard at. Because of that, she formed a band with her fellow schoolmates Toriko, Berry, and Pat (all monikers). However, after Rokka went to see SPACE live house's last show in Tokyo, she fell in love with Poppin'Party (who performed their song \"Mae e Susume!\" there) and began dreaming of moving to Tokyo. Rokka's middle school band disbanded when she was finally able to move to Tokyo and make her dream come true.\n\nHer father was at first against her decision to study in Tokyo, but Rokka persuaded him by finding a place to live and a school that offered a scholarship that made the tuition cheaper than that her local high school's. After intense studying and hard work, Rokka later passed Haneoka High School's entrance exam and moved to Tokyo.\n\n(Source: BanG Dream Wikia, edited)",

Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction)."

Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?\nStereotype Characters\nThen there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.\nPlot Twists\nFinally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect."

While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.\nThe audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.\nIf the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by the anime adaptation."

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders."

          "description": "Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.\nAs a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime."

Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.\nEven when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was \"really responsible\"."

In July 2020, she married fellow voice actor [Kensho Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/95819), whom she had been dating since 2017. \n\n__Early Career__\nHanazawa originally became a child actress at the age of 8. Amongst other roles, she starred in the well-known TV school show _Appare Sanma Daisensei_ and the TV series _Gakkou no Sensei_. At that time she was contracted to Big Apple, and later to Five Eight and Smile Monkey.\n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nAt the age of 14, she made her voice acting debut in 2003 as Holly in _[Last Exile](https://anilist.co/anime/97/)_. Three years later in 2006, she was selected for a major role in TV Tokyo's anime mecha series _[Zegapain](https://anilist.co/anime/878/)_. She was playing the main character's childhood friend, [Kaminagi Ryouko](https://anilist.co/character/2578/), and her performance was one of the main reasons for the character's popularity amongst fans. It was afterwards that she came under contract at prestigious voice acting talent agency Office Osawa in 2007.\n\nHanazawa went to university in 2007, while at the same time, she began to make her mark as a voice actress. She was voted in 2010 as \"Best Female Voice Actress\" by listeners of the radio program Nonko and Nobita's Anime Scramble. She graduated from university in 2011, and in the same year became a full-time voice actress.\n\nHanazawa won Best Supporting Actress at the 9th Seiyuu Awards for her role as [Kosaki Onodera](https://anilist.co/character/52723/) in _[Nisekoi](https://anilist.co/anime/18897/)_. She also won Newtype's Best Voice Actress award in 2015 and later in 2018.\n\n__Music Career__\nOn February 23, 2012, it was announced that Hanazawa would launch her official website. A few days later, during the Kana Hanazawa Solo Debut Presentation Party event, it was announced that she would release four singles within a year: \"Hoshizora Destination\" on April 25, \"Hatsukoi no Oto\" released on July 18, \"Happy Endings\" on October 24 (an ending theme for _[Zetsuen no Tempest](https://anilist.co/anime/14075/)_), and \"Silent Snow\" on January 16, 2013. Her first album Claire was released on February 20, 2013, and her second album 25 was released on February 26, 2014. She released an album title Blue Avenue in April 2015 and went on a concert tour starting at the Nippon Budokan on May 3. The Blu-ray release of the show, Live Avenue Kana Hanazawa in Budokan, ranked number six in sales.\n\n__Trivia__\n- She was invited to Anime Festival Asia 2010 on stage.\n- She used to be a junior idol in Akihabara where hundreds of people came to watch her, which is how she got her breakthrough for her acting career in commercials before becoming a voice actress.\n\n**Non-anime roles:**\n- [Marie](https://anilist.co/character/89069/Marie) - Persona 4 Golden (VG)\n- Hakari Atsuko - Blue Archive (VG)\n- Illya - Memento Mori (VG)\n- Marian - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Modernia - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Alice Kuonji (Caster) - Fate/Grand Order (VG)",

His high school life, other than a hinted incident 2 years ago, can be summed up as normal- if one can dismiss the secret fact that he used to be a female bestselling romance author. Due to that incident, however, he has now vowed never to write again.\n\nThis continued on until he was forced to join the literary club by the literary club president, the 3rd year female student Amano Tooko, a beautiful girl who has a taste for eating literary works. Now he has been tasked with writing her snack every day after school.\n\n(Source: To Say Nothing of the Dog)",

It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it's cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun's emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders."
