# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Session Context

**Active Role**: Backend Engineering
**Role Focus**: APIs, databases, system architecture, performance optimization
**Session Started**: September 26, 2025
**Key Priorities**: Vector database optimization, API performance, system scalability
**Role-Specific Goals**: Optimize backend performance and validate system architecture integrity

## Current Work Focus

**Today's Focus**: Phase 3.1 - 14-Vector System Validation with default BGE-M3 embeddings

**Active Task**: Per-Vector Search Quality Testing - Validate semantic accuracy across all 14 vectors (50% Complete)

**Current Status**: Staff vector comprehensively tested and validated, 7/14 vectors comprehensively tested, staff extraction fixes implemented

**Current Priority**: Continue validating remaining 7 text vectors with domain-specific queries

**Current Session Tasks**:
- [ ] **Per-Vector Search Quality Testing** (Est: 2 hours) - IN PROGRESS
  - [x] Test title_vector → COMPLETED - comprehensive validation with available data
  - [x] Test character_vector → COMPLETED - comprehensive validation including character_image_vector
  - [x] Test related_vector → COMPLETED - comprehensive validation with 8 query patterns, 80-100% success rates
  - [x] Test image_vector → COMPLETED - comprehensive validation with random image downloads (included in title vector test)
  - [x] Test episode_vector → COMPLETED - enhanced with duration/score fields, 75-80% success rate
  - [x] Test staff_vector → COMPLETED - comprehensive validation with 80% success rate, top-5 validation
  - [ ] Skip genre_vector testing → insufficient data for meaningful validation
  - [ ] Validate remaining 7 text vectors with domain-specific queries

- [ ] **Multi-Vector Fusion Validation** (Est: 2 hours)
  - [ ] Test search_complete() with complex multi-vector queries
  - [ ] Validate RRF fusion improves results vs single vectors
  - [ ] Test search_text_comprehensive() (12 text vectors combined)
  - [ ] Test search_visual_comprehensive() (2 image vectors combined)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Genre Enhancement Postponement Strategy

**Decision Point**: Genre vector accuracy improvement vs data availability

- **Infrastructure Status**: ✅ Complete (4,200+ LOC) - CLI, contrastive learning, data augmentation
- **Training Result**: 50.7% F1-score with advanced strategies
- **Critical Issue**: Only 28 anime entries vs required 5,500-11,000 for 90%+ accuracy
- **Decision**: Postpone genre enhancement until sufficient training data available
- **Current Approach**: Continue with default BGE-M3 system for now
- **Status**: Infrastructure ready for activation when data becomes available

### 2. 14-Vector System Validation Priority

**Decision Point**: System validation approach before optimization

- **Current Database**: 28 anime entries successfully indexed with 14-vector architecture
- **Validation Strategy**: Test each vector individually before multi-vector fusion testing
- **Success Criteria**: Semantic relevance validation for each vector type
- **Next Phase Dependency**: Validation results will inform Phase 4 sparse vector optimization

### 3. Default BGE-M3 System Status

**Decision Point**: Baseline system performance establishment

- **Architecture**: 12×1024-dim text vectors + 2×1024-dim visual vectors
- **Performance**: Individual vector operations confirmed working (100% success in previous testing)
- **Multi-vector API**: Native Qdrant fusion with RRF/DBSF implemented
- **Current Focus**: Semantic quality validation vs technical functionality validation
