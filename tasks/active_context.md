# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Work Focus

**Today's Focus**: Completing Memory Files documentation system and preparing for Phase 2 performance optimization

**Active Task**: Setting up comprehensive project documentation following Memory Files structure
- Created architecture.md with system diagrams and component relationships
- Documented technical stack and design decisions in technical.md  
- Established project progress tracking in tasks_plan.md
- Enhanced error documentation and lessons learned

**Current Sprint**: Week 6 of Phase 2 (Advanced Search Features)
**Sprint Goal**: Complete performance optimization and API documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Redis Caching Implementation
**Decision Point**: How to implement query result caching layer
- Redis identified as preferred solution for query result caching
- Need to finalize cache key strategy (query hash + filters)
- TTL strategy: 1 hour for search results, 24 hours for similarity results
- **Next**: Choose Redis deployment model (single instance vs cluster)

### 2. Model Loading Optimization  
**Decision Point**: Address 15-second cold start performance
- Model warm-up option partially implemented
- Need to decide on default behavior for production
- Memory usage vs startup time trade-off evaluation
- **Next**: Make model warm-up configurable via environment variable

### 3. API Documentation Completion
**Decision Point**: Level of detail for production-ready docs
- OpenAPI schemas complete, need usage examples
- Integration guides for common scenarios needed
- Performance best practices documentation pending
- **Next**: Add comprehensive examples to all endpoints

## Recent Changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24-48 hours)
1. **Complete Redis Integration** (8 hours)
   - Set up Redis service in docker-compose
   - Implement caching layer for search queries
   - Test performance impact and cache hit rates

2. **Finalize API Documentation** (6 hours)
   - Add usage examples for all endpoints
   - Create integration guides for common use cases
   - Document performance optimization best practices

3. **Model Loading Optimization** (4 hours)
   - Implement configurable model warm-up
   - Test cold start vs warm start performance
   - Document configuration options

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Performance Validation**
   - Benchmark with and without caching
   - Validate all response time targets met
   - Complete Phase 2 performance goals

2. **Production Readiness Prep**
   - Review Phase 3 requirements
   - Plan monitoring and alerting strategy
   - Design authentication framework

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Begin Phase 3** - Production readiness
2. **Security Implementation** - Authentication and rate limiting
3. **Monitoring Setup** - Prometheus and Grafana integration
