# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Work Focus

**Today's Focus**: COMPLETED full programmatic enrichment pipeline (Steps 1-5) with schema validation

**Active Task**: COMPLETED - Full enrichment pipeline implementation
- âœ… COMPLETED: ID extraction from platform URLs (Step 1) - 0.001s vs 5s with AI
- âœ… COMPLETED: Parallel API fetcher for concurrent data collection (Step 2) - 57 min for One Piece complete
- âœ… COMPLETED: Episode processor for data preprocessing (Step 3) - 1139 episodes + 1455 characters
- âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed Kitsu pagination (1347 episodes vs 10 before)
- âœ… COMPLETED: Step 5 assembly module with schema validation using validate_enrichment_database.py
- âœ… COMPLETED: Integration testing - pipeline validates and assembles complete AnimeEntry objects
- âœ… COMPLETED: End-to-end testing confirms all Steps 1-5 working together

**Current Sprint**: Week 6 of Phase 2 (Advanced Search Features)
**Sprint Goal**: Complete performance optimization and API documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Redis Caching Implementation
**Decision Point**: How to implement query result caching layer
- Redis identified as preferred solution for query result caching
- Need to finalize cache key strategy (query hash + filters)
- TTL strategy: 1 hour for search results, 24 hours for similarity results
- **Next**: Choose Redis deployment model (single instance vs cluster)

### 2. Model Loading Optimization  
**Decision Point**: Address 15-second cold start performance
- Model warm-up option partially implemented
- Need to decide on default behavior for production
- Memory usage vs startup time trade-off evaluation
- **Next**: Make model warm-up configurable via environment variable

### 3. API Documentation Completion
**Decision Point**: Level of detail for production-ready docs
- OpenAPI schemas complete, need usage examples
- Integration guides for common scenarios needed
- Performance best practices documentation pending
- **Next**: Add comprehensive examples to all endpoints

## Recent Changes

### Today (August 13, 2025)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Programmatic enrichment pipeline for Steps 1-3
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully integrated with existing API helpers (DRY principle)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Achieved 1000x performance improvement for deterministic tasks
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Tested with One Piece anime - fetched ALL data (1455 characters, 1139 episodes, 1347 Kitsu episodes)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed Kitsu helper pagination (10 â†’ 1347 episodes)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed AnimSchedule file duplication issue
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: All APIs working in production mode (Jikan, AniList, Kitsu, AniDB, Anime-Planet, AnimSchedule)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Created run_enrichment.py minimal script for pipeline execution
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Analyzed project market potential and acquisition scenarios

### Previous (August 5, 2025)

- âœ… Enhanced error documentation with historical context
- âœ… Created lessons learned intelligence database

### This Week
- âœ… Core vector search functionality validated and working
- âœ… Performance metrics established (80ms text, 250ms image search)
- âœ… Multi-vector architecture confirmed stable
- âœ… Client library integration tested and documented

### Pending Changes
- ðŸ”„ Redis caching layer implementation (planned this week)
- ðŸ”„ API documentation examples and guides (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ Model loading optimization (design phase)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Implement Step 5 Programmatic Assembly** (4-6 hours) - NEXT PRIORITY
   - Create assembly module to merge agentic AI stage outputs into AnimeEntry schema
   - Integrate validate_enrichment_database.py for schema compliance
   - Implement intelligent object-to-schema mapping based on prompt definitions
   - Test assembly with mock stage outputs
   - Target: Complete enrichment pipeline (Steps 1-5) ready for production

2. **Complete Redis Integration** (6 hours)
   - Set up Redis service in docker-compose
   - Implement caching layer for search queries
   - Test performance impact and cache hit rates

3. **Finalize API Documentation** (4 hours)
   - Add usage examples for all endpoints
   - Create integration guides for common use cases
   - Document performance optimization best practices

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Performance Validation**
   - Benchmark with and without caching
   - Validate all response time targets met
   - Complete Phase 2 performance goals

2. **Production Readiness Prep**
   - Review Phase 3 requirements
   - Plan monitoring and alerting strategy
   - Design authentication framework

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Begin Phase 3** - Production readiness
2. **Security Implementation** - Authentication and rate limiting
3. **Monitoring Setup** - Prometheus and Grafana integration
