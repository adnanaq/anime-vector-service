## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. 14-Vector Collection Implementation Strategy

**Decision Point**: Enhanced semantic separation with character image vector

- **Architecture**: 12 text vectors + 2 visual vectors (general images + character images)
- **Character Images**: Separate processing for character.images (Dict[str, str] per character)
- **General Images**: Covers, posters, banners, trailer thumbnails (excluding character images)
- **Semantic Benefits**: Character-based vs art style-based visual search separation
- Configuration-first approach: all changes start with settings.py modifications
- Parallel methods: new 14-vector methods alongside existing 13-vector methods
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Character image vector separation implemented and validated
- **Testing Results**: 100% individual vector success (70/70), pending multi-vector API fix

### 2. Vector Quantization Strategy

**Decision Point**: Optimal quantization configuration per vector priority

- High-priority vectors: Scalar quantization (int8) with always_ram=True
- Medium-priority vectors: Scalar quantization with disk storage
- Low-priority vectors: Binary quantization for maximum compression
- **Target**: 75% memory reduction (15GB → 4GB for 30K anime)

### 3. HNSW Parameter Optimization

**Decision Point**: Anime-specific HNSW configuration for optimal similarity matching

- High-priority: ef_construct=256, m=64, ef=128 for semantic richness
- Medium-priority: ef_construct=200, m=48, ef=64 for balanced performance
- Low-priority: ef_construct=128, m=32, ef=32 for efficiency
- **Focus**: Optimize for anime similarity detection patterns

### 4. Payload Indexing Strategy ✅ COMPLETED

**Decision Point**: Comprehensive vs selective field indexing

- Decision: Index ~60+ structured fields for complete filtering capability
- Payload-only: URLs and technical metadata (enrichment_metadata, enhanced_metadata)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Comprehensive payload optimization with dual strategy implemented
