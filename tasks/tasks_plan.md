# Tasks Plan and Project Progress

## Current Status

**Phase**: 2.5 of 5 (Million-Query Vector Optimization) - Week 7/8
**Overall Progress**: 95% complete
**Current Focus**: 13-vector collection implementation for million-query scalability
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 (Production Scale Optimization)
**Architecture**: Single comprehensive collection with 13 named vectors (12×1024-dim text + 1×1024-dim image)

## Rollback-Safe Implementation Strategy

**Key Principle**: Every sub-phase is designed to be rollback-safe with minimal impact:

### Rollback Safety Mechanisms
- **Settings Only Changes**: Sub-phases 2.5.1.x only modify configuration, easily reverted
- **Parallel Implementation**: New methods created alongside existing ones for gradual migration
- **Feature Flags**: Production features can be toggled on/off without code changes
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: All new systems fall back to existing functionality on failure
- **Checkpoint System**: Each sub-phase creates recovery checkpoints before changes
- **Validation Gates**: Comprehensive testing before affecting production systems

### Sub-Phase Size Principles
- **2-4 Hour Implementation**: Each sub-task can be completed in a single focused session
- **Atomic Changes**: Each sub-phase addresses one specific concern (e.g., only quantization config)
- **Independent Testing**: Each sub-phase can be tested and validated independently
- **Incremental Integration**: Changes integrate gradually without breaking existing functionality
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Each sub-phase has measurable success/failure criteria

### Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Status**: Each sub-phase tracks implementation progress (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Time Estimates**: Realistic time estimates based on complexity analysis
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear prerequisites and dependencies between sub-phases
- **Risk Assessment**: Each sub-phase includes rollback procedures and risk mitigation
