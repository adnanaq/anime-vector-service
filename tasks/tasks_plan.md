# Tasks Plan and Project Progress

## Current Status

**Phase**: 3.1 of 6 (Semantic Validation Framework) - Week 9/10
**Overall Progress**: 95% complete (Phase 2.5 complete, Phase 3.0 Genre Enhancement postponed due to data scarcity)
**Current Focus**: 14-vector system validation and semantic quality assurance
**Previous Achievement**: ✅ Phase 2.5 Million-Query Vector Optimization (Complete), ✅ Phase 3.0 Genre Enhancement Infrastructure (4,200+ LOC) - Awaiting data
**Next Phase**: Phase 4 (Sparse Vector Optimization)
**Architecture**: Single comprehensive collection with 14 named vectors (12×1024-dim text + 2×1024-dim visual)

## Rollback-Safe Implementation Strategy

**Key Principle**: Every sub-phase is designed to be rollback-safe with minimal impact:

### Rollback Safety Mechanisms

- **Settings Only Changes**: Sub-phases 2.5.1.x only modify configuration, easily reverted
- **Parallel Implementation**: New methods created alongside existing ones for gradual migration
- **Feature Flags**: Production features can be toggled on/off without code changes
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: All new systems fall back to existing functionality on failure
- **Checkpoint System**: Each sub-phase creates recovery checkpoints before changes
- **Validation Gates**: Comprehensive testing before affecting production systems

### Sub-Phase Size Principles

- **2-4 Hour Implementation**: Each sub-task can be completed in a single focused session
- **Atomic Changes**: Each sub-phase addresses one specific concern (e.g., only quantization config)
- **Independent Testing**: Each sub-phase can be tested and validated independently
- **Incremental Integration**: Changes integrate gradually without breaking existing functionality
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Each sub-phase has measurable success/failure criteria

### Progress Tracking

- **Real-time Status**: Each sub-phase tracks implementation progress (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Time Estimates**: Realistic time estimates based on complexity analysis
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear prerequisites and dependencies between sub-phases
- **Risk Assessment**: Each sub-phase includes rollback procedures and risk mitigation

## Critical Cross-Phase Dependencies and Prerequisites

### **Phase Execution Order (MANDATORY)**

```
Phase 2.5 (✅ COMPLETE) → Phase 3 (Validation) → Phase 4 (Sparse Vectors) → Phase 5 (Integration) → Phase 6 (Production)
```

### **Critical Dependencies Map**

- **Phase 3.0** (Data Pipeline Validation) → **MUST COMPLETE** before Phase 4 (sparse vectors need validated data)
- **Phase 3.1-3.2** (ML Validation Framework) → **MUST COMPLETE** before Phase 4.2 (learnable weights need validation metrics)
- **Phase 4.1** (Static Sparse Vectors) → **MUST COMPLETE** before Phase 4.2 (learnable weights need baseline)
- **Phase 5.1-5.2** (Integration) → **MUST COMPLETE** before Phase 6 (production infrastructure needs working integration)

### **Shared Infrastructure Requirements**

- **Validation Framework** (Phase 3) → Used by Sparse Vector evaluation (Phase 4.3)
- **API Logging** (Phase 3.2.2a) → Required for Weight Learning (Phase 4.2.1a)
- **Performance Monitoring** (Phase 3) → Required for Model Management (Phase 4.4)
- **Security Framework** (Phase 6.0) → Must integrate with all API endpoints from previous phases

### **Resource and Environment Dependencies**

- **Development Environment**: Phases 3-4 can run in development/staging
- **Production Environment**: Phase 5-6 require production-like environment with 38K+ anime data
- **Data Dependencies**: All phases require access to current anime_database collection
- **Model Dependencies**: Phases 4+ require validated BGE-M3 and OpenCLIP models from Phase 3
