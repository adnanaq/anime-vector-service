## Usage Guidelines

### Adding Knowledge
1. **Categorize First**: Determine the most appropriate category
2. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related knowledge in other categories
3. **Context Inclusion**: Include when/why this knowledge is applicable
4. **Update Index**: Maintain category index files for easy discovery

### Retrieving Knowledge
1. **Start with Category**: Begin with the most relevant category
2. **Use Cross-References**: Follow links to related information
3. **Check Updates**: Review recent additions for new insights
4. **Validate Applicability**: Ensure knowledge is current and relevant

### Maintenance
1. **Regular Reviews**: Monthly review for outdated information
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Move successful patterns from WORKING_LOG/
3. **Cross-Category Links**: Maintain relationships between categories
4. **Archive Obsolete**: Move outdated knowledge to archive/

## Integration with Memory System

### Feeds Into
- **rules/lessons-learned.md**: Distilled patterns and insights
- **rules/error-documentation.md**: Documented troubleshooting solutions
- **docs/architecture.md**: Architectural decisions and rationale

### Fed By
- **WORKING_LOG/**: Session-based discoveries and insights
- **tasks/active_context.md**: Current development learnings
- **External Research**: Technology evaluations and studies

### Cross-References
- Each knowledge-base entry includes references to:
  - Related memory files
  - Applicable token protocols
  - Session logs where pattern emerged
  - Architecture components affected
