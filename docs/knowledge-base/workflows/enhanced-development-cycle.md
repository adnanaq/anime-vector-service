# Enhanced Development Cycle

## Overview
Development workflow that integrates memory persistence principles with our token-based rules system for continuous learning and context preservation.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Session Initialization
**Context Gathering Phase**
```
@PRE_IMPL → Context Questions → Historical Context → Current Priorities
```

**Activities:**
- Review recent WORKING_LOG/ entries
- Check active_context.md for current priorities
- Ask context-setting questions
- Load relevant memory from knowledge-base/

### 2. Implementation Phase
**Pattern Application Phase**
```
@LESSONS + @ERRORS → Implementation → @SIM_TEST → Validation
```

**Activities:**
- Apply proven patterns from knowledge-base/patterns/
- Reference error-documentation.md for known issues
- Simulate changes before implementation
- Validate against architectural constraints

### 3. Learning Capture Phase
**Memory Persistence Phase**
```
@MEM_UPDATE → Session Log → Pattern Extraction → Rule Evolution
```

**Activities:**
- Document session insights in WORKING_LOG/
- Extract successful patterns for knowledge-base/
- Update active_context.md with current state
- Trigger @SELF_UPDATE for rule evolution

### 4. Knowledge Integration Phase
**Cross-Session Learning Phase**
```
Pattern Analysis → Rule Updates → Context Preparation → Next Session Setup
```

**Activities:**
- Analyze patterns for knowledge-base/ categorization
- Update rules based on session outcomes
- Prepare context for next development session
- Link current work to historical patterns

## Core Principles Integration

### Living Memory Persistence
- Each session builds on previous knowledge
- Context preserved across development cycles
- Decisions documented with full reasoning
- Historical patterns inform current work

### Learning Compounds
- Successful patterns become reusable knowledge
- Error resolutions prevent future issues
- Architectural insights guide system evolution
- Performance optimizations accumulate

### Adaptive Framework
- Rules evolve based on project needs
- Workflow adapts to development patterns
- Context awareness drives better decisions
- System learns from successes and failures

## Practical Implementation

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Setup** (5 min):
   - Review previous session WORKING_LOG/
   - Check active_context.md priorities
   - Load relevant knowledge-base/ content

2. **Development Session** (variable):
   - Apply @PRE_IMPL protocol with context questions
   - Use @LESSONS and @ERRORS for guidance
   - Document decisions in real-time

3. **Session Wrap-up** (10 min):
   - Complete WORKING_LOG/ entry
   - Extract patterns for knowledge-base/
   - Update active_context.md
   - Prepare next session context

### Weekly Review
1. **Pattern Extraction** (30 min):
   - Review week's WORKING_LOG/ entries
   - Identify successful patterns
   - Categorize into knowledge-base/
   - Update rules/lessons-learned.md

2. **Rule Evolution** (15 min):
   - Assess rule effectiveness
   - Trigger @SELF_UPDATE for improvements
   - Update protocol tokens based on usage
   - Document rule changes

## Success Metrics

### Context Preservation
- Time to context reload at session start
- Relevance of historical patterns applied
- Effectiveness of memory-guided decisions

### Learning Velocity
- Rate of pattern discovery and application
- Error prevention through historical knowledge
- Speed of problem resolution using memory

### Development Efficiency
- Reduced context switching time
- Faster problem-solving through pattern reuse
- Improved decision quality through historical insight

## Integration Points

### With Token System
- @PRE_IMPL enhanced with context-setting questions
- @LESSONS includes WORKING_LOG/ insights
- @MEM_UPDATE triggers session memory capture
- @SELF_UPDATE drives rule evolution

### With Memory Files
- WORKING_LOG/ captures session-specific insights
- knowledge-base/ provides structured pattern storage
- active_context.md maintains current development state
- rules/ files evolve based on session outcomes
