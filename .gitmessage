# --------------------
# Remember to:
#    - Use imperative mood in subject line (e.g., "add" not "added")
#    - Capitalize subject line
#    - Do not end subject line with period
#    - Separate subject from body with blank line
#    - Use body to explain what and why vs. how
#    - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body

# Semantic Versioning Impact:
#    feat     → minor version bump (0.X.0)
#    fix      → patch version bump (0.0.X)
